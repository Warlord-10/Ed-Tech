Ed-Tech Web App

The	IT	industry	is	gaining	its popularity	in	the	Education	Sector	
specially	when	a	lot	of	changes	are	observed	in	the	Indian	
Education	System	due	to	the	effects	by	The	New	Education	
Policy.	

# Problem:	
Students	these	days	are	facing	a	lot	of	issues	while	preparing
for	various	competitive	examinations	like	JEE	and	NEET.	There	
are	several	apps	which	do	provide	various	materials to	serve
the	purpose. But the	presence	of	so many	options available	to	
the	students,	it	creates	confusion as	which	to	select.
Along	with	this, the	main	problem	faced	by	the	students	is	the	
lack	of	practice	and	due	to this	they	face	difficulty finding their	
weak	spots and	to	know	their	current	position	in	terms	of	
preparation.


# Solution:
With	the	problems	being	known	and	facing	them	personally,	I	
came	up	with a	web	based	EdTech App.
The	database	filled	with	vast	questions	allows	students to	
practice	as	much	as	they	want.	It	further	enables	them	to	
choose	the	desired	chapters	they	want	to	practice thus	allowing	
them	to	work	on	their	weak	and	strong	chapters.
The	next	problem	which	needed	to	be	tackled	was	to provide
students with an	environment	of	competitive	examination to	
further	strengthen	their	preparations.	It	was	accomplished	by	
developing	a	Test	Mode	which enables	to	give	a	3-hour test,
with	result	being	saved	in	the	database	for	future	access	and	
analysis.
At	last, the	practice	mode	comes	with	3	levels	of	questions	as	
Easy,	Medium	and	Hard	which	lets	one	practice	as	per	their	
current	preparation.
